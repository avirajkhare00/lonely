To complete the PWA setup, you'll need to create two PNG icon files:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor or convert the SVG files we've already created using an online converter like https://convertio.co/svg-png/ or https://ezgif.com/svg-to-png

The icons should be placed in the /public directory.

Alternatively, you can install the sharp package and use our script:
1. npm install sharp
2. node scripts/generate-icons.js
